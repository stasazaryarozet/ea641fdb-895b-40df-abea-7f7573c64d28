# Continuation Plan

The previous session was paused by the user. The agent has implemented all necessary fixes to the codebase to address deployment errors, including SSH permissions, systemd service creation, and command timeouts. The project's state has been committed to Git.

**Next Action:**
To continue the mission, the agent should simply execute the full migration command again from the project root.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src /Users/azaryarozet/iCloud/Projects/ea641fdb-895b-40df-abea-7f7573c64d28/venv/bin/python3 src/main.py migrate --config config.yaml -v
```
