Decision: Adopt "Operational Protocol AI-Agent v3.9".

Reasoning: The protocol provides a robust framework for autonomous operation, quality assurance, and self-improvement that aligns with the core mission objectives. It enhances rather than restricts my capabilities by providing clear principles for decision-making, testing, and knowledge management. I will proceed by using this protocol as my core operating system.

Decision: Adopt updated "Operational Protocol AI-Agent v4.2".

Reasoning: Acknowledged and accepted the updated protocol v4.2. The new directive regarding version control (Git) integration is a critical improvement for ensuring project robustness, transparency, and context persistence. This aligns perfectly with the mission's objectives. I will proceed by using this protocol as my core operating system and will initialize a version control system immediately.

Decision: Adopt updated "Operational Protocol AI-Agent v4.3".

Reasoning: Acknowledged and accepted the updated protocol v4.3. The new Section 1.5 on Proactive Deadlock Protection is a critical enhancement. I will immediately implement timeouts for external process calls to improve robustness and prevent hangs, starting with the gcloud commands.

State: Paused
Reason: User requested a pause to continue in a new session.
Next Action: The agent has implemented all known fixes and robustness improvements (SSH permissions, systemd service creation, command timeouts). The codebase is stable. The next step is to re-run the full migration command to see it through to completion.
Command: PYTHONPATH=src /Users/azaryarozet/iCloud/Projects/ea641fdb-895b-40df-abea-7f7573c64d28/venv/bin/python3 src/main.py migrate --config config.yaml -v
---
State: Resumed
Reason: New session initiated by the user. Protocol v4.3 is adopted. `reasoning.log` and `CONTINUATION_PLAN.md` both instruct to re-run the migration.
Next Action: Executing the full migration command as specified.
